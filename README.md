# Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining

This repository contains reports for the DTU course [Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining (02450)](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/courses/02450/), fall semester 2023.
Goals of the projects were to develop and statistically compare different machine learning models trained on the [Countries of the World dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023).
The projects were written by Eva Ka≈°telan, Noa Margeta and Filip Penzar.

[Report 1](./reports/Report_1.pdf) focuses on data preprocessing and cleaning, data visualization and analysis.\
[Report 2](./reports/Report_2.pdf) explaines machine learning models applied to the data.
